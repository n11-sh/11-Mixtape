  <div class="important-message">
    ⚠️ Warning: This project is being developed by a teenager with basic experience. 
    The kernel is experimental. Expect bugs, errors, and confusion. Use at your own 
    risk. This is not maintained by a professional team or adult experts.

  <p class="description">
    11 Mixtape is an experimental kernel project designed to explore the foundations of 
    secure and minimal operating system design. Unlike traditional kernels, it focuses 
    on fortification, deliberate isolation, and explicit tradeoffs rather than broad 
    compatibility or convenience. Users can experiment with its early design and 
    learn from its architecture, but the system is highly experimental, may contain 
    bugs, and should not be used as a primary operating system.
  </p>

  <p class="description">
    The kernel aims to provide a platform for understanding how minimal, security-focused 
    systems behave. It includes a basic shell and package manager as a starting point, 
    and future versions may expand toward more complex features like sound support or 
    desktop environments. Every aspect of development is openly documented, but the 
    project is maintained solely by a single developer.
