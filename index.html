  <h1>11 Mixtape</h1>


  <div class="important-message">
    ⚠️ Important notice: 11 Mixtape is being developed by a teenager with basic technical
    knowledge, not by a professional team or experienced kernel engineers. This project
    is experimental, unstable, and currently under very early development. Expect bugs,
    missing features, design mistakes, and confusion. Use at your own risk.
  </div>

  
  <p class="description">
    11 Mixtape is an experimental operating system kernel project focused on learning,
    exploration, and gradual development of a fortified and security-oriented system.
    The goal is not to compete with existing kernels, but to explore alternative design
    decisions, minimalism, and security tradeoffs while building something usable over
    time.
  </p>

  <p class="description">
    The kernel is currently in an extremely early stage of development. At this point,
    it is closer to a concept and architectural foundation than a functional operating
    system. Many core components are still being planned, redesigned, or not implemented
    at all. Progress will be slow, incremental, and sometimes paused for long periods.
    This is expected and intentional.
  </p>

  <p class="description">
    Planned features include a minimal custom shell, a simple package management system,
    and built-in utilities focused on security-related use cases. Future versions aim
    to gradually introduce tools for basic pentesting, forensic analysis, and networking,
    alongside system hardening techniques intended to reduce attack surface and improve
    isolation.
  </p>

  <p class="description">
    Compatibility with more complex components such as sound systems, graphical interfaces,
    or desktop environments is not a current priority, but may be explored in later stages
    depending on the maturity of the kernel and available resources. All features are
    planned to arrive progressively through versions, updates, and patches rather than
    all at once.
  </p>

  <p class="description">
    11 Mixtape exists as a long-term learning project. It values transparency, experimentation,
    and patience over polish or performance. Users interested in following the project
    should expect an evolving system shaped by trial, error, and iteration.
  </p>
