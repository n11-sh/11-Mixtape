    <h1>11 Mixtape</h1>

    <div class="important-message" role="alert">
      ⚠️ Important notice: 11 Mixtape is being developed by a teenager with basic technical
      knowledge, not by a professional team or experienced kernel engineers. This project
      is experimental, unstable, and currently under very early development. Expect bugs,
      missing features, design mistakes, and confusion. Use at your own risk.
    </div>

    <p class="description">
      11 Mixtape is an experimental operating system kernel project focused on learning,
      exploration, and the gradual construction of a fortified, security-oriented system.
      Its goal is not to replace existing operating systems, but to explore how strict
      security decisions shape usability, flexibility, and long-term system behavior.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
      The kernel is currently in an extremely early stage of development. At this point,
      it exists more as a conceptual and architectural foundation than a functional system.
      Core components are still being designed, revised, or not implemented at all.
      Progress is expected to be slow, iterative, and sometimes paused entirely.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
      Planned features include a minimal custom shell, a simple package management system,
      and built-in utilities focused on security-related workflows such as pentesting,
      forensic analysis, and network inspection. These features will be introduced
      progressively through versions, updates, and patches.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
      While 11 Mixtape prioritizes security over convenience, future versions may explore
      limited daily-use capabilities. This includes optional graphical environments,
      basic web browsing, media playback, and extensive visual customization
      ("ricing"). The system is not intended for heavy gaming or performance-demanding
      workloads. Support for platforms like Steam is unlikely, though lightweight or
      specialized applications may be explored experimentally.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
      11 Mixtape is a long-term learning project built on transparency, experimentation,
      and patience. It values architectural clarity and security research over polish,
      speed, or mass adoption.
    </p>
