  <h1>Kira</h1>

  <div class="content">

    <h2>Who is Kira?</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Kira</span> is the official mascot and symbolic face of
      the 11 Mixtape project. She is not just a decorative character or a branding
      placeholder, but a visual representation of the philosophy behind the kernel:
      alert, cautious, resilient, and quietly intelligent.
    </p>

    <h2>Why a Red Panda?</h2>
    <p>
      The red panda was chosen deliberately. Unlike more common mascots such as wolves,
      dragons, or penguins, the red panda represents a balance between softness and
      survival. It is a calm animal, not aggressive by default, yet capable of defending
      itself when necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
      This mirrors the design goals of 11 Mixtape. The system is not built to dominate,
      conquer, or replace everything else. It exists to protect itself, stay contained,
      and remain vigilant against external threats.
    </p>

    <h2>Symbolism</h2>
    <p>
      Kira represents a system that does not blindly trust its environment. Curious, but
      careful. Friendly, but not naïve. She embodies the idea that security does not have
      to look hostile or intimidating to be effective.
    </p>

    <p>
      The calm appearance contrasts with the strict internal rules of the kernel, just
      as 11 Mixtape may look simple on the surface while enforcing heavy restrictions
      internally.
    </p>

    <h2>The Creator’s Connection</h2>
    <p>
      Beyond symbolism, Kira exists because the creator genuinely loves red pandas.
      The mascot reflects personal taste, emotional attachment, and identity rather
      than corporate branding logic.
    </p>

    <p>
      This personal connection reinforces the nature of 11 Mixtape as an individual,
      human-driven project. It is not designed by committee, marketing strategy, or
      trends, but by curiosity, care, and a desire to build something meaningful.
    </p>

    <h2>More Than a Mascot</h2>
    <p>
      Kira is intended to remain a long-term part of the project. As 11 Mixtape evolves,
      the mascot may appear in documentation, tools, interfaces, or visual elements,
      reinforcing continuity and identity across versions.
    </p>

    <p>
      She is not a joke, not a placeholder, and not an afterthought. She is part of the
      system’s personality.
    </p>
