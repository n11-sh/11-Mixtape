# 11 Mixtape

11 Mixtape is a conceptual, security-focused kernel project currently in its
early design and identity phase.

This repository contains the official website and public-facing materials.

## What this project aims to be
11 Mixtape explores the idea of a fortified kernel built around minimalism,
explicit security decisions, and intentional limitations rather than feature
accumulation.

The goal is not mass adoption, but clarity, experimentation, and learning.

## Current status
No kernel code exists yet.

At this stage, the project focuses on concept development, visual identity,
documentation, and long-term design direction.

## Development philosophy
11 Mixtape will have a single canonical upstream maintained by its author.
Forks and derivative projects will be allowed, but official releases will remain
clearly distinguished.

## Scope of this repository
This repository is **only** for the official website and related assets.
Kernel development will be handled separately.
